# Asset Testing

When creating custom content for Unturned, you'll need to test your assets for bugs. Here are some methods of easily reloading your assets.

## Reload Command

In 3.19.18.0 the __reload__ command was introduced which can be used to reload specific assets or directories of assets while playing. For example:

    /reload 6b91a94f01b6472eaca31d9420ec2367

## Reload All Assets

In order to reload all core, workshop, and custom assets, just press the reload assets hotkey, which is defaulted to `pg up`. After pressing this button your game will reload all of your assets without the need of restarting the game.
