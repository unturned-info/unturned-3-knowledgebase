# Generating Item Icons

To generate .png files of item icons for your own usage, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the workshop tab in the main menu.
2. Press `Shift + F1`. A menu will pop up. Here, you can specify items to be generated by specifying a GUID, or you can instead press "All Item Icons" to generate every item icon for vanilla and installed assets.
3. Generation of icons may take a while. After the game is done generating them, you can find your newly generated icons in the `Unturned/Extras` folder.
