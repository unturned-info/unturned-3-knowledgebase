# Currency Asset

!!! note "This is an [Asset v2](AssetTypes/AssetsV2.md) class."

Any collection of items with different numeric values can be associated together in a __Currency__ asset. NPCs can then automatically convert between the different items, and vendor menus can display information using the linked currency. This is intended to be useful beyond real-world currencies, e.g. bartering ammunition.

## Asset Setup

The currency asset defines how numbers are formatted, which items make up the currency, and their individual values. An example can be found at Bundles/Items/Supplies/CanadianCurrency.asset.

__ValueFormat__: String to format numeric value into.

__Entries__: Array of items in the currency. Each has an __Item__ GUID and __Value__ integer. For example these are the $10 and $20 notes in the Canadian currency:

    {
        "Item"
        {
            "GUID" "b6b87dfad5f342dc91bbb2de950f56ee"
        }
        "Value" "10"
    }
    {
        "Item"
        {
            "GUID" "3b9847bb328d445495b64be9e5ea9400"
        }
        "Value" "20"
    }

To link a vendor with a currency set the vendor asset's __Currency__ to the currency asset's GUID. Vendors display all of the items sorted from lowest to highest value.

## NPC Logic

Conditions can use the __Currency__ type to require different total amounts in the player's inventory. Rewards can use the __Currency__ type as well to grant amounts. Each of these uses the following properties:

__GUID__: Currency asset's GUID.

__Value__: Total value of currency.

## Testing

The built-in "give" command accepts currency GUIDs as an alternative to item IDs. For example the following grants $1,000 CAD to the local player:

    /give 5150ca8f765d4a68bfe54912146da410/1000
