# Vehicle Data

**Vehicles** in _Unturned_ consist of the 6 different engine types, Car, Plane, Helicopter, Blimp, Boat, and Train. Many properties of the different engine types are shared between them, however, some are specific to each engine type, and are categorized as such below.

## Vehicle Agnostic properties

---

__ID__: The item ID is used to spawn the item into the game, and is represented as an unsigned 16 bit integer (a range of 0–65535). It is recommended not to use a value less than 2,000 as those are reserved for official content. It is also recommended to avoid any ID range being used by curated content, as those are often used by modded servers and custom Workshop maps. Vehicles ID ranges do not conflict with those of Items or Objects.

__Bypass\_ID\_Limit__: Allows you to use an ID that is within the space reserved for vanilla content, the game will throw an exception if you use an ID below 200 otherwise.

__Size2\_Z__: Controls orthogonal camera size for vehicle skin icons. Basically irrelevant since very few vehicles have skins. Defaults to `0.0`

__Shared_Skin_Name__:

__Shared_Skin_Lookup_ID__ ID of base vehicle that is being skinned. i.e. the vehicle's ID. Defaults to `ID`.

__Engine__: `Car`, `Plane`, `Helicopter`, `Blimp`, `Boat`, `Train`. Defaults to `Car`.

    Center_Of_Mass_x
    Center_Of_Mass_y
    Center_Of_Mass_z

__Wheel_Collider_Mass_Override__: Overrides the setting of your wheel colliders mass to provided value. Should default to `3`.

__Physics_Profile__: Physics Profile GUID. [Documentation can be found here](../VehiclePhysicsProfile.md)

__Traction__: Changes the wheels physics on ice and off-road.

__Sleds__: Makes the wheels slide easier. For use on planes where this effect is desired.

### Fuel

__Fuel\_Min__: Minimum fuel that the vehicle can spawn with.

__Fuel\_Max__: Maximum fuel that the vehicle can spawn with.

__Fuel__: Maximum amount of fuel the vehicle can hold.

__Fuel\_Burn\_Rate__: The rate fuel burns at. Set to 2.05 for Car, 4.2 for others by default.

### Health

__Health__: Health of the vehicle. Vehicle spawns with this health by default.

__Health\_Min__: Minimum health that the vehicle can spawn with.

__Health\_Max__: Maximum health that the vehicle can spawn with.

### Explosion

__Explosion__: ID of the explosion effect to use when destroyed.

__Explosion_Min_Force_Y__: Defaults to `(00, 1024, 0.0)`. To set this property, include any of the below with a value.

    Explosion_Min_Force_Y_x
    Explosion_Min_Force_Y_y
    Explosion_Min_Force_Y_z

__Explosion_Max_Force_Y__: Defaults to `(00, 1024, 0.0)`. To set this property, include any of the below with a value. Any unspecified values are set to defaults

    Explosion_Max_Force_Y_x
    Explosion_Max_Force_Y_y
    Explosion_Max_Force_Y_z

### Turret Properties

__Turrets__: `x` Specifies the number of turrets on the vehicle.

__Turret\_`x`\_Seat_Index\_`y`__: Specifies which `Seat_y` the turret will use. `x` stands for the index of the turret (goes from 0,1,2...)

__Turret\_`x`\_Item\_ID__: Specifies the ID of the turret weapon (IT IS ADVISED that the turret gun has Turret in it's .dat)

__Turret\_`x`\_Yaw_Min__: Yaw determines turret rotation. `_Min` decides for the left side (Keep number lower than -180 if you want a forever spinny boi)

__Turret\_`x`\_Yaw_Max__: Determines turret rotation to the right side. (Keep number higher than 180 if you want a forever spinny boi) -360 and 360 make forever spinny boi

__Turret\_`x`\_Pitch_Min__: Specifies how high the Pitch of the turret can go. ↑ (This is called elevation)
