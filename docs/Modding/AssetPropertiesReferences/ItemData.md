## Non-specific Data

This first set of data is universal, and is applicable to any item type. Some of this data is required in order for the item to function.

__GUID__: The GUID is automatically generated for the item when the game is launched. If it is not automatically generated, then it is assumable that the content was not set up properly.

__Type__: Each category of item has its own type. The type to use can be found for each specific item category below, and is used for the item's context type as viewed in the context menu.

__Rarity__: `Common`, `Uncommon`, `Rare`, `Epic`, `Legendary`, `Mythical`. Defaults to common.

__Useable__: This defines which class to use for the item when equipped. If unspecified it will default to None, meaning that the item cannot be equipped. Which value to use for equippable items can be found below for each item category.

__Slot__: `Primary`, `Secondary`, `Any`

__ID__: The item ID is used to spawn the item into the game, and is represented as an unsigned 16 bit integer (a range of 0–65535). It is recommended not to use a value less than 2,000 as those are reserved for official content. It is also recommended to avoid any ID range being used by curated content, as those are often used by modded servers and custom Workshop maps.
