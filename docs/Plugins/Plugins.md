# Plugins

 Plugins are a type of modification that can be used to add new features and functionality to the game. They are typically downloaded and installed on servers. Some examples of things that plugins can do include creating useful commands, managing server moderation, as well as changing gameplay mechanics or providing additional customization options.

 ## Plugin Frameworks

 There are several plugin frameworks for Unturned that can be used on servers. Each one has different capabilities, but serve the general purpose of creating server-side programming modifications for the game.

 ### RocketMod

 RocketMod was the first plugin framework for Unturned that was widely used. Its creators are Sven Mawby "fr34kyn01535" and Enes Sadık Özbek "Trojaner". SDG maintains a fork of Rocket called the Legally Distinct Missile (or LDM) after the resignation of its original community team. Using this fork is recommended because it preserves compatibility, and has fixes for important legacy Rocket issues like multithreading exceptions and teleportation exploits.

 ### OpenMod

 OpenMod is a spiritual successor to Rocket developed by one of Rocket's original maintainers. It has its own plugin framework, but supports compatibility with existing Rocket plugins by integrating with RocketMod and LDM. Compared to its predecessor, it instead uses .yml for its configuration files, and features a more well-organized framework compared to RocketMod.
