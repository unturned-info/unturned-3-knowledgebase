# The workshop folder

Steam stores all your workshop downloads within a game specific folder. For unturned, both subscribed workshop items, and those downloaded by servers appear here. It's common for players to accumulate large numbers of ghost mods which are loaded by the game but aren't subscribed to on steam. The easiest way to remove these is clearing your workshop folder.

## Steps

1. Navigate to your steam folder

    * This is typically located at `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\workshop\content\304930`, but can change depending on your steam install directory.

2. Now that you've navigated to the folder, you can delete the folders inside of it

!!! warning
    if you're a modder **or** edit anything in this folder, make sure you back up your unpublished/edited work **before deleting**

Now your game should launch faster, and should have a significantly reduced memory footprint. Any mods you've subscribed to will be downloaded again by steam automatically.
