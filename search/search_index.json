How these are setup and used has evolved over the years from individual *.unity3d bundles to .content bundles to .masterbundle files. Master Bundles should be used for essentially all new projects. Tool Setup \u00b6 Prior to using any of these tools they must be imported into a Unity project Inside Unity open the Assets > Import Package > Custom Package... wizard. Find the Unturned installation directory. Navigate to the Bundles/Sources directory. Import the Project.unitypackage. Individual Asset Bundles (*.unity3d) \u00b6 Most official files have transitioned to the master bundle system, but some uses still exist like the per-map road textures. Tool Usage \u00b6 Follow Tool Setup instructions. Open the tool from the Window > Unturned > Bundle Tool menu. Select individual assets or directories of assets in the Project window. Click Grab to preview which assets will be exported. Click Bundle to choose a destination for the asset bundle file. Motivations \u00b6 When beginning development of 3.0, it was key to support runtime loading of custom modded content. At the time files in asset bundles were loaded by name without extension, so each game type looked for specific names like \"Item\", \"Object\", \"Animal\", etc. The .unity3d extension was chosen for web browser compatibility. Obviously this system did not age well. Content Bundles (*.content) \u00b6 Warning The game no longer loads .content files. MasterBundles now support all the features of a .content file, and the .content file tooling has been removed from Project.unitypackage This format was by devkit landscapes, material palettes and radio songs, but has now replaced by master bundles. Tool Usage \u00b6 Follow Tool Setup instructions. Open the tool from the Window > Unturned > Content Tool menu. Select directories of assets in the Project window. In the Inspector window tag them in an asset bundle ending with \".content\". Click ... to choose a destination for the content bundle file. Click Export. Motivations \u00b6 In late 2016 and early 2017 development was focused on improving the editor experience, and one aspect of that was asset bundling. Content bundles scanned a manifest of contained assets in order to allow browsing individually from the in-game editor, and the idea was to allow each content reference to be configured per-game-property. Unfortunately, this effort was far too broad - from building an interface between the game code / online subsystem code to revising the ID system to use GUIDs. In retrospect it would have been wiser to crack down on individual features which has been the approach since then. Master Bundles (*.masterbundle) \u00b6 Most official files including curated maps have been transitioned to master bundles, and they will be used for the foreseeable future. File Setup \u00b6 Master bundles can be loaded from any directory the game loads *.dat files from. Unless an override is specified, the nearest master bundle in the file hierarchy is used. While loading each directory is checked for a MasterBundle.dat file signaling the presence of a master bundle. For example, refer to the core.masterbundle in the Bundles directory. MasterBundle.dat can set the following keys: // Name of asset bundle file in the same directory as MasterBundle.dat. Asset_Bundle_Name core.masterbundle // Path to the asset bundle within Unity. // Unity subfolders should match 1:1 with dat subfolders. Asset_Prefix Assets/CoreMasterBundle // Version 3 is Unity 2018.4 LTS. Older versions have shader consolidation enabled for backwards compatibility. Asset_Bundle_Version 3 Individual asset *.dats can set the following keys: // Name of master bundle to load files from. Master_Bundle_Override core.masterbundle // If included, look for an individual *.unity3d asset bundle instead. Exclude_From_Master_Bundle // Path within master bundle to load files from. // Used by notes to share a common object prefab.

Select directories of assets in the Project window. In the Inspector window tag them in any asset bundle. Click the checkbox next to an asset bundle's name in the tool to mark it as a master bundle. This filters the list of asset bundles to show, and tracks an export path associated with it. Click the ... to choose a destination for the bundle file. Click Export. Motivations \u00b6 When upgrading to Unity 2017.4 LTS it became apparent that all asset bundles would have to be re-exported from Unity due to shader compatibility changes. This would be an incredible amount of files, so it was time to re-approach the *.content issue in a way that could quickly convert all existing content.

Navmesh Readable : Object navmeshes should have the CPU Readable flag enabled in Unity. This is required for Recast to be able to generate the level navmesh. Mesh Readable : Most non-navmesh meshes do not need to have the CPU Readable flag enabled in Unity.

Missing Meshes : Mesh filters without a mesh, or mesh renderers without a mesh filter are found and logged. Mesh Vertex Counts : Meshes with unusually high numbers of vertices are recommended to be optimized. Typically this is simply a matter of removing unused faces and vertices. Colliders have a lower recommended target because collision against complex meshes is slower than rendering complex meshes. Missing Materials : Renderers without materials are found and logged. One exception to this is \"DepthMask\" renderers which are set by the game. Material Counts : Renderers with high numbers of materials are recommended to be merged and simplified. Each individual material needs to be rendered separately (usually), so less materials is better.

They help players find high-quality new experiences, and keep the game updated with fresh content. Modders can then earn money from their work on their hobby, and get their creations highlighted. Menu Visibility \u00b6 One key component of sharing a curated map, trending popular workshop item, or specifically featured map is spotlighting it on the main menu. In any of these cases an article is placed above the recent news and announcements showcasing the preview image, and an expandable description. In-game the description supports the following BBCode tags: [b] [i] [list] [*] [h1] [img] [url] Ideally descriptions are kept succinct, so separate discussion topics might be a better place for long sections like ID lists. By default popular items are surfaced, but workshop items can be specifically featured to help bring attention to projects with a lot of effort put into them, and curated maps. This can be done for new releases or major updates. Updates can link to a separate URL for the release notes. Additionally, curated maps are linked from the singleplayer curated maps list, and will inherit the main menu \"new\" or \"updated\" label. Quality Assurance \u00b6 The primary focus of this article at the time of posting is to begin laying out standards to help ensure top quality between maps. This will be an iterative process, and is open to collaboration and feedback from the community. Map Variety : New maps should feel noticeably different in order to be a candidate for curation. This is a subjective rule, and is covered by factors like interesting progression, new items, new environments, new architecture styles, new buildings, etc. Asset Validation : Running the game with the -ValidateAssets command-line flag should not produce any warnings or errors. English Text : Having an English-speaking member of the mod team is recommended, and MoltonMontro has offered to help with English-related questions. Most importantly in this regard is proper punctuation and grammar: while native English speakers can easily read incorrect punctuation, it is very helpful for non-native readers. Ironically this paragraph probably has some punctuation errors. Project Organization : To prevent unintended assets from being exported into asset bundles, convention is to separate the project files into Sources and MasterBundle directories. Hawaii is split between a directory called \"HawaiiMasterBundle\" in the project root, and a Sources directory which contains all of the .blend, .mb, .xcf, .psd, .ai, etc files. When exporting the asset bundle this ensures only game files like .fbx and .prefab are included. Asset Duplication : If multiple objects share identical prefabs, or use vanilla content, asset bundle size can be improved by sharing the same prefabs. For an example of this refer to the vanilla notes using Bundle_Override_Path. Water Reflections : When using water volumes, only one should have planar reflections enabled. These reflections require rendering the world a second time for each enabled volume, and are some of the most performance expensive effects in the game. Overlapping Navmeshes : No bounds should overlap. Otherwise zombies will appear and disappear unexpectedly in multiplayer. Visibility Overlay : The visibility menu in the editor sums the mesh complexity in each region. Ideally there should only be a few red zones. Item Icons : Each item should have a proper icon in the inventory. One way to quickly preview the icon is to attach an orthographic camera in Unity, and tune the orthographic size before setting the size in the .dat file. Stockpile Preparation \u00b6 Each curated map release is usually accompanied by a few cosmetics and skins in the game's item store. Royalties from the sales are shared with the mod team. Even if a project is not eligible for curation, it may be appropriate to have some support-the-creator items in the Stockpile e.g. the Candyland map. File Sharing : Ideally the items have been setup for use as clothes in-game, and then exported into a .unitypackage. This package will then be imported into the vanilla project. Curated Workshop Item : Payment splits are handled by a hidden curated workshop item. Setting this up usually takes a few weeks for new contributors bank and tax information to be processed. Bundles : Two or three collections of sets of four to six items. Mystery Boxes : Fifteen to twenty items that have individual value (not parts of sets like a shirt/pants). Eligibility for Curation \u00b6 Even if a map is of substantial quality, it may not be eligible for curation. When considering eligibility, it is important that the map fits the vanilla style of the game. Although not every map should be curated, it is important to recognize the amount of effort that modders have put into their projects. Depending on the direction of the project, non-vanilla assets should either be adjusted to fit the vanilla style, or alternatives to curation should be considered instead. Vanilla-style maps are eligible for curation, whereas non-vanilla maps are eligible to be featured. To help support the creators, both are eligible for revenue sharing cosmetic content in the game's item store e.g. the Candyland map. It is encouraged to still work on a project even if it is not eligible for curation. Creating a variety of Workshop content creates a valuable portfolio for future curation attempts, and may still benefit from being featured.","title":"Curated Maps"},{"location":"Modding/mapmaking/CuratedMaps/#curated-maps","text":"","title":"Curated Maps"},{"location":"Modding/mapmaking/CuratedMaps/#overview","text":"Community-created updates and maps that are officially linked from the game are considered Curated Maps .

Thanks string[] : Names in credits. Associated_Stockpile_Items int[] : Economy itemdefids to feature on map screens. One is chosen at random each time the map is shown. Used by curated maps to link their items which have payment splits. Feedback string : URL to discussions. If not explicitly set, defaults to the workshop item's discussions page. Visible_In_Matchmaking bool : Should this map be listed in the matchmaking menu? Used to filter out test and demo maps. Version string : X.Y.Z.W style version number. Vanilla version numbers use 3.Year.Update.Patch, but that's optional. Servers will reject clients with different map versions. Tips int : Number of Tip_# keys defined in level's localization files, if any. Overrides vanilla tip messages on the loading screen. Arena Mode \u00b6 Use_Arena_Compactor bool : Should circles be randomized periodically? Arena_Loadouts : Array of items to grant when spawning into arena. Each entry has a Table_ID spawn table to generate from, and an Amount number of times to grant from spawn table.

For example: \"Asset\" : { \"GUID\" : \"12dc9fdbe9974022afd21158ad54b76a\" } For instance, to add Yukon's gentle constant snowfall to your map, you would add this JSON to your config (assuming you have no Asset key alread): \"Asset\" : { \"GUID\" : \"537278c5f6eb45198994ff2915d3107b\" } This adds a Weather Asset type Asset V2 to your map. Trains : Array of train vehicles to spawn. Only one of each train asset can exist at a given time because the vehicle ID is used to match saved trains to tracks. Road index can be seen by selecting a road in the level editor. Placement is normalized between the start and end of the track length.

One way to think of it is that when there are multiple devices (e.g. computers and phones) connected to the LAN, the outside internet does not know which device is the Unturned server. In this case, port forwarding specifies which LAN device is the host. Two pieces of information: the port range and local device address are required before port forwarding, and are described in detail below. Caution Depending on your ISP and other factors, it may not be possible for you to port forward in any capacity. Additionally, many ISPs block certain ports for security and network management purposes. Port Range \u00b6 Each Unturned server uses three consecutive ports while running. The first is used for game traffic, the second for server list queries, and the third for communicating with the Steam backend services. By default 27015 and 27016 are used. Setting a different value with the Port command uses that value and value + 1. Recommended Port command settings are 27015 for the first server, 27017 for the second server, 27019 for the third server, so on and so forth. Local Device Address \u00b6 Forwarding the ports directs them to a LAN address, i.e. the computer hosting the server. To determine the local IP: Windows Ubuntu Press Windows + R to open the Run dialog. Type cmd and press enter. Type ipconfig in the command prompt and press enter. Find the Wireless LAN adapter Wi-Fi or Ethernet adapter Ethernet header. Look for the IPv4 Address value and make note of it. This is the internal IP you will forward the ports to. It likely looks something like 192.168.0.6 . Open a terminal of your choice. Run the command hostname -i in your terminal. Note the outputted IP addresses. The first one is likely your localhost address. Note You can also find your localhost address under the networking menu within the GUI. Forwarding Ports \u00b6 Instructions vary by router but should be doable from the web browser without any extra tools or software. This third-party website has a thorough list of routers with simple steps for each model: https://portforward.com/router.htm Note Before you begin, you'll need administrator access to your router. In general, the steps are along the lines of: Connect to the router via a web browser. Tip The addresses for these are often either 192.168.0.1 , 10.0.0.1 , or 172.16.0.1 . Login with home admin credentials. Find the Port Forwarding menu. Find the option to add a new rule. Use a name that will help you identify it in the future. Input 27015 as the starting port(s), and 27016 as the ending port(s). Note On some routers, it may not be possible to input multiple ports within a single rule. In that case, multiple rules can be set up; one for each of the three ports. Enable TCP and UDP protocols. Set destination internal IP to the localhost address. In the previous example, our localhost address was 192.168.0.6 Save the new rule.
